	<h1>Here is my little story i have to tell</h1>

	<p>
		Love to read. When I was young I would finish book after book with surprising speed, chapter after chapter, the words blended together as the hours passed. "Harry Potter." The "Warriors" series. I loved them all. Every Saturday at noon my local library would have a book sale to get rid of all the unwanted books and I always went late, so the 'book hounds' would be gone, you know, the people who buy them for cheap prices and then sell them on websites like Ebay for higher prices. All my books were well loved, each one like a child to me. I could read through an entire series in a week and I was damn proud of it. My mom was too. I was her little reader, her smart kid. Her normal kid.

		As I got older, I was allowed to stay out later and later, my mom growing less concerned with my safety and more with my younger brothers, Stephen and William, who don't come into this story other than this one mention, to connect to you, reader, to show I am a real person.
